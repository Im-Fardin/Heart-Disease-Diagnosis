🫀 Heart Disease Diagnosis

A machine learning-powered approach to heart disease prediction and diagnosis. This project leverages advanced algorithms to analyze patient data and assess potential risks. Designed for efficiency and accuracy, it aims to support healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

📌 Features

Predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient data

Utilizes machine learning models for classification

Visualizes key health metrics and model performance

Includes Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis

Dockerized for easy deployment


🧠 Algorithms Used

1. Logistic Regression

2. Random Forest

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

5. XGBoost
